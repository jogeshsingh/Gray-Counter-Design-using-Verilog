# Gray-Counter-Design-using-Verilog
This Project Deals with Implementing Gray Counter using Two modules (Binary to Gray || and || Gray to binary) , Gray encoding is helpful technique used in FIFO based design where data has to be synchronized and should include lesser number of bit repetition changes . as more the number of bit flips , higher the chances become of metastability and data incoherency , so to deal with that gray encoding is used , in which I engineered Gray Counter which could be used as an intermediate design unit to process the data at coherent rate . This was designed in Quartus 20.1 Lite Edition and simulated in Modelsim Environment .
